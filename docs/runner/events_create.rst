Events Create Story Runner YAML
...........................................

:code:`asset_label` must match the :code:`asset_label` setting when the asset was created in a previous
creation step (action is either :code:`ASSETS_CREATE` or :code:`ASSETS_CREATE_IF_NOT_EXISTS`).

The optional :code:`attachments` setting uploads the attachments to archivist and the response
added to the event before posting.

The optional :code:`location` setting creates the location if it does not exist and adds it to
the event.

The optional :code:`sbom` setting uploads the sbom to archivist and the response added to the
event before posting. (see second example below)

:code:`confirm: true` means that the step will wait for the event to be completely created before moving on to the next step.
