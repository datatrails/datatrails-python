Assets Create Story Runner YAML
.........................................

A simple Asset Creation Example.

:code:`asset_label` is not required but if unspecified the created asset will
not be accessible to later actions in the story.

The :code:`arc_namespace` (for the asset) and the :code:`namespace` (for the location) are used
to distinguish between assets and locations created between runs of the story.

Usually these field values are derived from an environment variable 
:code:`ARCHIVIST_NAMESPACE` (default value is :code:`namespace`).

The optional :code:`confirm: true` entry means that the step will wait for the asset to be completely created before moving on to the next step.
