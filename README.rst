Jitsuin Archivist Client
=========================

The standard Jitsuin Archivist python client.

Please note that the canonical API for Jitsuin Archivist is always the REST API
documented at https://docs.rkvst.com

Installation
=============

Use standard python pip utility:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install jitsuin-archivist

Example
=============

One can then use the examples code to create assets (see examples directory):

.. code-block:: python

    """Create an asset given url to Archivist and user Token.

    The module contains two functions: main and create_asset. Main function parses in
    a url to the Archivist and credentials, which is a user authorization.
    The main function would initialize an archivist connection using the url and
    the credentials, called "arch", then call arch.assets.create() and the asset will be created.
    """

    from os import getenv

    from archivist.archivist import Archivist
    from archivist.proof_mechanism import ProofMechanism


    def create_asset(arch):
        """Create an asset using Archivist Connection.

File Story Runner
=================

One can run scenarios - a sequence of steps - from a python dictionary or from a yaml
or json file.

Python
------

.. code-block:: python

    from logging import getLogger
    from sys import exit as sys_exit
    from sys import stdout as sys_stdout
    import yaml

    from ... import archivist as type_helper
    from ... import about
    from ...parser import common_parser, endpoint

    LOGGER = getLogger(__name__)

    def run(arch: "type_helper.Archivist", args):

        LOGGER.info("Using version %s of jitsuin-archivist", about.__version__)
        LOGGER.info("Namespace %s", args.namespace)

        with open(args.yamlfile, "r", encoding="utf-8") as y:
            arch.runner(yaml.load(y, Loader=yaml.SafeLoader))

        sys_exit(0)

    def main():
        parser = common_parser("Executes the archivist runner from a yaml file")

        parser.add_argument(
            "yamlfile", help="the yaml file describing the steps to conduct"
        )
        args = parser.parse_args()

        arch = endpoint(args)

        run(arch, args)

        parser.print_help(sys_stdout)
        sys_exit(1)


Command Line
------------

This functionality is also available from the command line:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ archivist_runner -h

to elucidate options.

To invoke this command:

    - obtain bearer token and put in file 'credentials/token'
    - choose which yaml file to use
    - get the URL of your Archivist instance

Execute:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ archivist_runner \
         -u https://app.rkvst.io \
         -t credentials/token \
         functests/test_resources/richness_story.yaml


Example Yaml Snippet
--------------------

This is an example of creating an asset and creating an event for that asset. The
yaml file consiste of a list of steps.

Each step consists of control parameters (specified in the 'step' dictionary) and 
the yaml representation of the request body for an asset or event.

The confirm: field is a control variable for the PythonSDK that ensures that the
asset or event is confirmed before returning.

.. note::

   The name of the asset is important. The value of the name is carried forward for
   every operation - in this case the name of the asset is 'radiation bag 1'.

   Arguments to the archivist are ususally strings - in this example radioactive is 
   'true' which archivist will treat as a boolesn.


.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    # Demonstration of applying a Richness compliance policy to an asset that undergoes
    # events that may or may not make the asset compliant or non-compliant.
    #
    # The operation field is a string that represents the method bound to an endpoint and
    # the args and kwargs correspond to the arguments to such a method.
    #
    # NB the assets and events endpoints require all values to be strings. Other values may
    # be of the correct type such as confirm which is a boolean.
    #
    steps:

      # note the values to the assets.create method are string representations of boolean
      # and numbers
      - step:
          action: ASSETS_CREATE
          description: Create an empty radiation bag with id 1.
        behaviours:
          - Attachments
          - RecordEvidence
        attributes:
          arc_display_name: radiation bag 1
          radioactive: "true"
          radiation_level: "0"
          weight: "0"
        confirm: true

      # setup the radiation bags to have a varing amount of radiactive waste
      # note the values to the events.create method are string representations of boolean
      # and numbers
      - step:
          action: EVENTS_CREATE
          description: Create Event adding 3 rads of radiation to bag 1, increasing its weight by 1kg.
          asset_name: radiation bag 1
        operation: Record
        behaviour: RecordEvidence
        event_attributes:
          arc_description: add waste to bag
          arc_evidence: see attached conformance report
          conformance_report: blobs/e2a1d16c-03cd-45a1-8cd0-690831df1273
        asset_attributes:
          radiation_level: "3"
          weight: "1"
        confirm: true

Logging
========

Follows the Django model as described here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/logging/

The base logger for this package is rooted at "archivist" with subloggers for each endpoint:

.. note::
    archivist.archivist
        sublogger for archivist submodule

    archivist.assets
        sublogger for assets submodule

and for other endpoints.

Logging is configured by either defining a root logger with suitable handlers, formatters etc. or
by using dictionary configuration as described here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dictschema

A recommended minimum configuration would be:

.. code-block:: python

    import logging

    logging.dictConfig({
        "version": 1,
        "disable_existing_loggers": False,
        "handlers": {
            "console": {
                "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
            },
        },
        "root": {
            "handlers": ["console"],
            "level": "INFO",
        },
    })
