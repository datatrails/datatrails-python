"""Create an asset given url to Archivist and user Token.

The module contains two functions: main and create_asset. Main function parses in
a url to the Archivist and credentials, which is a user authorization.
The main function would initialize an archivist connection using the url and
the credentials, called "arch", then call arch.assets.create() and the asset will be created.
