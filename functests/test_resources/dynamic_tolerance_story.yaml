# Demonstration of applying a Dynamic Tolerance compliance policy to an asset that undergoes
# events that may or may not make the asset compliant or non-compliant.
#
# The step field is a string that represents the method bound to an endpoint and
# the args and kwargs correspond to the arguments to such a method.
#
# NB the assets and events endpoints require all values to be strings. Other values may
# be of the correct type such as confirm which is a boolean.
#
# For example attributes.ev_pump is a string - internally archivist will see this
# as a boolean.
