# Demonstration of applying a Richness compliance policy to an asset that undergoes
# events that may or may not make the asset compliant or non-compliant.

# The step field is a string that represents the method bound to an endpoint.
#
# NB the assets and events endpoints require all values to be strings. Other values may
# be of the correct type such as confirm which is a boolean.
