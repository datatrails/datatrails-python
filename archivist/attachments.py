"""Attachments interface

   Direct access to the attachments endpoint

   The user is not expected to use this class directly. It is an attribute of the
   :class:`Archivist` class.

   For example instantiate an Archivist instance and execute the methods of the class:

   .. code-block:: python

      with open(".auth_token", mode="r") as tokenfile:
          authtoken = tokenfile.read().strip()

      # Initialize connection to Archivist
      arch = Archivist(
          "https://app.rkvst.io",
          auth=authtoken,
      )
      with open("something.jpg") as fd:
          attachment = arch.attachments.upload(fd)
